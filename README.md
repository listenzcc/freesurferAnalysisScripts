## Recommend Pipeline

### FreeSurfer Analysis

1. User has to convert the .nii file of the **T1 Image** into `001.mgz`.

    ```sh
    # Just convert the $NIIFile into the 001.mgz, **in the same folder**.
    mri_convert $NIIFile 001.mgz
    ```

2. Generate the subject's folder in **freeSurfer**.

    **EDIT** is required.

    ```sh
    # In ./shells folder
    # The script will create subject of freeSurfer and link the 001.mgz file into it in the correct way.
    # ! Make sure **EDIT** it to fit your own data
    sh initFolderFreeSurferSubject.sh
    ```

3. Perform **freeSurfer** analysis in full mode.

    ```sh
    # Use setsid to set an individual process,
    # and preserve the log file
    # since it is **VERY** time consuming.
    #
    # The $SUBJECT variable is the name of the freeSurferSubject,
    # one can find the names in the $FREESURFER_HOME/subjects
    setsid recon-all -s $SUBJECT -all >> $SUBJECT.log
    ```

### FSL Intersection

4. Link your `FSL` folders.

    ```sh
    # In ./shells folder
    # $FEATDIR is the feat directory of the FSL results
    # It will make the dir of featdirs,
    # and link the required files
    sh linkFeatDirs $FEATDIR
    ```

5. Register the `FSL` results into the standard space

    **EDIT** is required.

    ```sh
    # Edit the script as the example shows,
    # it will automatically operate the ./registerFeatDir.sh,
    # to finish the register jobs.
    #
    # ./registerFeatDir.sh $FSLFeatDir $FreeSurferSubject
    #
    # The setsid method is also recommended since the job is also time consuming
    setsid sh registerAll.sh >> registerAll.log
    ```

6. Generate `.mgz` files for `FSL` results.
   The procedure is to generate the files for group analysis in group-level,
   the `z-stats` files are converted and calculated

    **EDIT** is required.

    1. Create the folder of `groupAnalysis`;
    2. Copy and edit the python scripts named as
        - `batch_mris_preproc.py`,
          it generates the shell script to convert the `z-stats` files into `.mgz` format;
        - `batch_mri_concat.py`,
          it generates the shell script to concat the `.mgz` files of several subjects.
    3. Make sure you edit them to fit your own data.
    4. They will generate `.sh` files

        ```sh
        # The scripts are generated by the python scripts
        setsid sh batch_mris_preproc.sh >> batch_mris_preproc.log
        setsid sh batch_mri_concat.sh >> batch_mri_concat.log
        ```

    5. All your data will be saved in the `groupAnalysis/data` folder.

## Prepare Data

The `T1 MRI Image` is required to make the cortex surfer.
The first step is fit the data into the format of `FreeSurfer`.

1. To do that, it is required to make the private `subject` folder in the `$FreeSurfer_HOME/Subjects` dir;
2. And generate the structure as `{subject}/mri/orig`;
3. Put the `T1 Image` into it, and name it like `001.mgz`,
   the script of [./shells/initFolderFreeSurferSubject.sh](./shells/initFolderFreeSurferSubject.sh) is generated to do the stuff;
4. The `.mgz` file is converted from `.nii` format by the shell tools named as `mri_convert`;
    ```sh
    # Convert the T1 MRI image <src> into <dst> file
    # The <src> file can be .nii file
    # Make sure the <dst> ends with .mgz
    mri_convert <src> <dst>
    ```
5. Finally, just operate the magic command `recon-all -s {subject} -all` and the jobs will be done;
6. Beware that the operation costs times, like **hours**;
7. After the operation, the `{subject}` folder will be filled with the files ready for everything.

If everything is alright,
The `{subject}` folder will follow the structure as below

| name | path                 | description |
| ---- | -------------------- | ----------- |
|      | ./scripts            |             |
|      | ./mri                |             |
|      | ./mri/transforms     |             |
|      | ./mri/transforms/bak |             |
|      | ./mri/orig           |             |
|      | ./surf               |             |
|      | ./tmp                |             |
|      | ./label              |             |
|      | ./touch              |             |
|      | ./stats              |             |
|      | ./trash              |             |

I will fill the blank table in later, (maybe not).

## Cortex visualization

The `freeview` tool provides amazing GUI to display the cortex surface.

---

## FSL portable

If you prefer using the `FSL` to do the fMRI analysis,
it provides the registration method to register the `feat` into cortex surface.

I use 2-steps operation to do the job

1. Link the directory of feat of `FSL`,
   use the script of [./shells/linkFeatDirs.sh](./shells/linkFeatDirs.sh);

2. Register the .nii.gz files in the feat directory to the subject of `FreeSurfer`,
   use the script of [./shells/registerFeatdir.sh](./shells/registerFeatdir.sh).

Basically, the functional of `reg-feat2anat` is used to do the registration

```sh
reg-feat2anat --feat $featdir --subject $subject
```

And it generates the nifti files in the folder of `$featdir/reg_surf-<lh | rh>-<$subject | fsaverage>`.
The nifti has a very strange format of `1974 x 1 x 83 = 163842` for the fsaverage version.
The document reads below

> In this case, the common space is the left hemisphere of fsaverage.
> Surface-based smoothing of 5mm FWHM is used.
> The output lh.cope1.mgh looks like a volume because it is in mgh format, but it is really a surface stored in a volume format (note it's dimensions are 1974 x 1 x 83 = 163842 = number of vertices in fsaverage's surface).

The nifti file can be read by the python package of `babel`,
and the script of [./read_nii.py](./read_nii.py) gives an example.

**Todo: I do not quite sure how to align the `1974 x 1 x 84` matrix with the `163842` vertex in the fsaverage's surface.**
**Will `arr.flatten()` do the job?**

The answer is NO,
actually, the following code will put the values into the **RIGHT** position

```js
const raw = await FileAttachment("zstat1.nii.gz.csv").csv();
const arr = [];
// This explains how to align .nii.gz matrix into the vertex array
for (let j = 0; j < 83; j++) {
    for (let i = 0; i < 1974; i++) {
        arr.push(1.0 * raw[i][j]);
    }
}
return arr;
```
